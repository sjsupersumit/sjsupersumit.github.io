Someone has rightly said that time flies like an arrow. I still remember starting this year with almost a month long vacation and now here I am at end the of this year 
contemplating about how all of it passed by. Between the failed attempts of the getting better at my fitness and then trying to navigate through the corporate politics, I saw and learnt a lot about peoples, their hidden motivations and about their abilites to push through the difficult times. I realized what they say and what they meant are not usually the same. This year I had done several things which I had never done before in my life and it surprisingly also includes reading books. Now dont get me wrong, I am not
trying to say that I had never read a book before but all those books were related to academia which were usually about technical subjects, computer programming and thing li
ke that. I started reading books which were not directly related about my profession of software engineering. I read about 10-12 books this years ranging from complete ficti
on to Evolution theory to human phycology. I discovered the joy of reading and am planning to read atleast 20 books in 2017. I started taking my health seriously this year a
nd tried going to gym. I continued that for about 2 months and was starting to love the idea of getting up early in the morning and hitting the gym but unfortunately my 
freind quitted the gym so I also stopped because going out that too alone is just too much of a task for me. Later in this year I again started jogging in this winter morning
and much to my surprise I was getting better at it by each passing day. We hit the 5Km milestone, to give you an idea I was kind of guy who cannot even run for 200 metrers. A
gain my freind had to change city due to his job and we stopped. Sometimes I think how things would turn out if I wasn't be such an introverted person. 2016 taught me a lot a
bout the failures, frustations and about how shallow and selfish some people turn out to be. I learnt about my capabilites to improve and not giving up when things are not tu
rning out to be my way.

With al those thoughts in my mind, I bid aideu to 2016 and Wishes all of you a very happy and prosperous new year. May we all could acheive what we sought out in the coming year.
